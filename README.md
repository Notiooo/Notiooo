## About me
I'm working as C++ Software Engineer at Nokia headquarters in Krakow, Poland.

Besides that:
- I love C++, but Python is my second language. It's where I started and it's what got me started reading my first programming books.
- You can follow my book reading progress here: https://books.grobert.eu/
- Computer graphics is my hobby.
- ...although I also try to play the piano in my spare time.

## Projects can be seen on my website
